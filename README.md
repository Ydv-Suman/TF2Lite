🧠 TF2Lite: Train & Convert a TensorFlow Model to TFLite
This project demonstrates how to train a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow, convert it to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), and run inference using the TFLite interpreter. It's designed for beginners looking to understand how to deploy ML models on mobile or edge devices.

🚀 What’s Inside
✅ Train a basic Dense(units=1) model

✅ Save the model in TensorFlow SavedModel format

✅ Convert the model to .tflite using TFLiteConverter

✅ Load and run inference using the TFLite Interpreter

📁 Files
TfLite.ipynb — Full end-to-end notebook for training, conversion, and inference

saved_model/ — Exported TensorFlow SavedModel (created during notebook execution)

model.tflite — TFLite version of the model (output of conversion)

🧪 How to Run

- Train the model in the notebook
- Save and convert to TFLite format
- Run inference using the TFLite interpreter
